    <h2>‘Man Utd will be his destination’ – Harry Kane backed for Premier League return from Bayern Munich as Tottenham transfer is ruled out
    </h2>

<p>
 
    Harry Kane has been backed for a Premier League return, with the prolific striker being told “Manchester United will be his destination”.
</p>

 <p>
    The England captain bid farewell to his homeland in the summer of 2023 when completing a big-money transfer to Bayern Munich. He has broken through the 30-goal barrier in Germany, but is in danger of ending his debut campaign at the Allianz Arena without the major silverware that he craves.
 </p>

<p>Kane is expected to stick around in Munich long enough to see that he does collect honours that have so far proved 
    elusive, having signed a contract until 2027, but he is also being tipped to retrace steps to the Premier League at some stage.

    Spurs have admitted to having a buy-back option on Kane, but West Ham coach Kevin Nolan sees the 30-year-old frontman heading to Old Trafford. He has told talKSPORT: “I can certainly see him back in the Premier League. I don’t think Tottenham would have ever have sold him to Manchester United, but for him to go to Bayern Munich, then it’s easier for him to come back from Germany and I think Man United will be his destination. I think they (Bayern) would want their money back. Of course (he is worth it). 20+ goals every season and he was playing for Tottenham during them times as well. Realistically, are Man United as good as Tottenham? But I just think he brings a different
     aura to them anyway, a different aura to the team as soon as he puts the shirt on for, whoever. But I probably think Man United would be the one.”
